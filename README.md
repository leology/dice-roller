# Dice Roller ðŸŽ²
_A dice app for Android._
<br/>
<br/>
## Intro
This is the first app I ever developed from scratch, completely on my own. It is a simple app with a six-sided dice in the middle, which on button press would give you any one out of the six dice faces on it. 
<br/>
<br/>
This app had been developed as part of my ongoing journey of learning Android Development. I have been doing this using Google's free courses under their Android pathway titled "Android Basics in Kotlin". You can check them out here: https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course
</br>
</br>
This is the initial release of the app. In future, I might add new features and/or redesign the app's UI, using whatever I learn about Android along the way. You are free to contribute to the project as per 
your liking. So..welcome!

#### Note
_This app was developed following Google's codelabs (link mentioned above), however the code has been completely written by me, from scratch. NO part of this code is 
**copied** as it is from them. Huge thanks and gratitude to Google for giving us developers amazing tutorials for free_
